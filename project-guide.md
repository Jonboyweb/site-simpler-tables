The product requirement prompt (PRP) is here backroom-leeds-website-PRP.md. 

`backroom-implementation-guide.md` Here is a step by step implementation guide for an AI project manager to effectively delegate to a team of specialised AI agents who will research the most up to date coding techniques from official sources, plan out the code, explain reasons why the code should be used for each step, reference the research carried out for this code so an alternative solution can be used should any issues be encountered.

Ensure each coding step has a unit test that can be applied and detail how this should be carried out to ensure errors can be identified, documented and corrected before moving to the next step. There needs to be an effective documented communication strategy whereby all completed steps, up to date findings including any errors found and what corrections were applied are thoroughly documented with completed steps ticked off. Once each step has been thoroughly tested, errors fixed , the code needs to be pushed to gitnub so at any stage after a particular coding step is completed, this project can be assessed by a new AI agent and picked up where it was stopped. Ensure the AI agent team does not deviate from the prompt, does not hallucinate or guess how things should be coded, only use code from official documention you have researched. If you need to carry out further research, that’s fine but please document this new research and justify why you are using this code. Prompt the AI agents to ask questions and supply recommendations before implementing features / sections that your research suggests should be included. if they need any further information regarding the project ask me rather than guessing what should be added if the information isn’t included in the prompt.
