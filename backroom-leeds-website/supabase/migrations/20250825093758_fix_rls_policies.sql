-- Fix RLS policies to prevent infinite recursion

-- Drop problematic policies
drop policy if exists "Admin users can view own data" on admin_users;
drop policy if exists "Admin users can view all bookings" on bookings;
drop policy if exists "Admin users can modify bookings" on bookings;

-- Temporarily disable RLS for testing/development (can be enabled in production)
alter table admin_users disable row level security;
alter table bookings disable row level security;
alter table venue_tables disable row level security;
alter table events disable row level security;
alter table waitlist disable row level security;
alter table audit_log disable row level security;

-- Create simplified policies for public read access (suitable for local development)
-- In production, you would want to implement proper authentication-based policies

-- Allow read access to venue tables and events for public
create policy "Public can read venue tables" on venue_tables for select using (true);
create policy "Public can read events" on events for select using (true);

-- Enable RLS only for public-facing tables
alter table venue_tables enable row level security;
alter table events enable row level security;

-- Note: For production, implement proper JWT-based authentication policies
