 I want to build a website for a prohibition themed night club and event space called “the backroom” in Leeds. It is popular for weekend DJ-led events, table bookings and private hire. The website needs to have the following sections:
- Events : Weekly Event listings with CTA buttons for event tickets (which link to the Backroom’s fatsoma events page https://www.fatsoma.com/p/backroomleeds ) & table reservations, which link to the table bookings page.
- Table bookings page: Table bookings system with real-time availability for automated table bookings. During the booking process the customer can select an event or date, number of guests, choose an available table from a list, select their choice of drinks package or choose a custom selection from the bottle menu. A £50 deposit is required to book a table, the remaining cost paid on the night. 
- Private Hire: detail the venue, its layout, the entertainment options, drinks & catering options to drive sales enquiries for private hire, corporate events, club nights, Christmas parties. 
- Contact page for general enquiries, lost property, job enquiries, feedback. 
- Artists / DJ section.
